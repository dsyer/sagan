  # This optional property may be assigned using a "personal access token" created
  # at https://github.com/settings/applications. It is used for accessing GitHub's
  # API, even for operations that do not require authorization (e.g. Getting Started
  # Guide repositories). This is done in order to work against higher rate limits
  # (5000req/hour vs. the default 60req/hour without a token). When running the app
  # locally, this lower default is fine. When running the app in production, the
  # token is a must. See http://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting.
